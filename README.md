### What is Jewel?
Jewel is a programming langauge with a focus on speed, memory safety and simple abstractions. It is currently under going a refactor from C++ to Rust and will be available for a closed beta in summer 2025.
Inspired by C, C++, Haskell, Rust and Bash; Jewel supports many common language features like 
- Proceduaral Programming
- Functional Programming
- Algebraic Data Types

### Use Cases
#### Browser Configuration/Scripting
Jewel's Type-System is designed to be useful for configuring and scripting the Hypertrail Web Browser.
Hypertrail is the sister-application of Jewel based on the Chromium Browser. Jewel is used to write background processes, custom functions, tools and feature configrations for the browser.
First class confifuration frameworks and APIs are currently being developed to give the language full access to the browser's features

#### Systems/Command-line Applications
Jewel code can also be compiled using LLVM as the backend with no garbage collector when used ased a systems language. Memory safety is enforced using a modified ownership model inspired by rust's borrow checker and C++'s lifetimes.
